# 3D Page Carousel in SwiftUI

This project showcases a **3D Page Carousel** built using SwiftUI. The implementation uses `TabView` and `GeometryReader` to create a visually engaging, interactive carousel with a 3D rotation effect as the user swipes between pages.

## Features

- **3D Rotation Effect**: Pages rotate dynamically as you swipe, creating a perspective effect.
- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Perspective depth.
  - Rotation angle.
  - Number of pages.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Pages feature gradient opacities and can display custom content.
- **State Management**: Uses `@State` and `@GestureState` for smooth interactions.
